## General Information
EarthQuakeAnalyzer (EQA) is a powerful tool designed for evertbody who has interest in seismology and related fields. It allows users to fetch, process, analyze, and visualize earthquake data from the USGS API. The application provides a user-friendly interface for inputting parameters and displays comprehensive analysis results, including statistical data, visualizations, and seismic hazard assessments.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.11
- NumPy
- Pandas
- CartoPy
- MathplotLib
- wxPython


## Features
- Fetch and process earthquake data from USGS API
- Interactive GUI for data input and result display
- Advanced seismic activity analysis, including:
  - Aftershock patterns
  - Activity change over time
  - Correlation between earthquake depth and magnitude
- Seismic hazard assessment with region-specific recommendations
- Analysis of seismic activity changes between two time periods
- Continent-based filtering of earthquake data

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: wxPython might require additional setup steps depending on your operating system. Please refer to the wxPython documentation for specific instructions.

## Usage
1. Run the main.py file to start the application:
 - python main.py
2. Use the GUI to input the desired parameters:
3. Select Start and end dates for the analysis period
4. Minimum magnitude of earthquakes to consider
5. Select a continent (or all continents)
6. Click the "Analyze" button to process the data and view the results
7. Explore the generated visualizations and analysis reports
